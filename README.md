## Programmer-Calculator-Windows-10

Functional replica of the Windows 10 programmer calculator using Swing - GUI widget toolkit for Java from Oracle's Java Foundation Classes API.

This calculator adds the ability to switch between different number systems—binary, decimal, hexadecimal, and octal. It also adds new operations for working with logic gates—Or, And, Xor, and lets you switch between Byte (8 bits), Word (16 bits), DWord (32 bits), and QWord (64 bits).
